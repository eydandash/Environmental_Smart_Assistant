     boundaries for reporting GHG emissions. It includes direct and indirect emission sources, categorised into 
     “scopes” which Defra lists as follows: •	Scope 1 (Direct emissions): Activities owned or controlled by your 
     organisation that release emissions straight into the atmosphere. They are direct emissions. Examples of scope 1 
     emissions include emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles; emissions from 
     chemical production in owned or controlled process equipment. •	Scope 2 (Energy indirect): Emissions being 
     released into the atmosphere associated with your consumption of purchased electricity, heat, steam and cooling. 
     These are indirect emissions that are a consequence of your organisation’s activities but which occur at sources 
     you do not own or control. •	Scope 3 (Other indirect): Emissions that are a consequence of your actions, 
     which occur at sources which you do not own or control and which are not classed as scope 2 emissions. Examples 
     of scope 3 emissions are business travel by means not owned or controlled by your organisation, waste disposal, 
     or purchased materials or fuels. Beyond scope 3 emissions, the GHG hierarchy also provides options to take 
     additional measures to “substitute, reduce and avoid” GHG emissions. These might include purchasing renewable 
     energy, carbon offsetting or woodland creation as a carbon sink"""},

     explanations. Where you report your data is a matter of choice: for some companies it may be their annual report 
     / business review or it may be in a separate corporate responsibility / sustainability report. Organisations 
     which do not publish such external reports may wish to publicly disclose this information on their website. To 
     help you maintain a meaningful and consistent comparison of emissions over time, you will need to choose and 
     report on a base year. Your base year should be: • The earliest year that verifiable emissions data is available

     figures. Leading suppliers have responded positing their commitment to leakage performance in meeting targets. 
     CCWater has reported that only four companies missed their targets this year, raising the concern that targets 
     aren’t “challenging enough”. As pointed out by Tony Smith, chief executive of CCWater, suppliers’ failures to 
     address leakage issues can have a negative effect on consumer attitudes to water saving. Leakage figures have 
     been reduced by a third since the mid-1990s and Ofwat has proposed suppliers work towards a 15% leak reduction 
     between 2020 and 2025. Continued pressure by these organisations means consumers will benefit from the 
     associated effect improvements will have on their water bills. Viewed within a broader context, the wastefulness 
     of the leaks highlights the role of all members of the supply chain in reducing leakage and saving water, 
     which will have both financial and environmental benefits. """},

     pipes run and where the shut-off valves are located. Should a pipe suddenly burst, someone will then be able to 
     shut off the mains quickly to avoid water wastage. Insulate your pipes to reduce the risk of water freezing and 
     pipes bursting. Check your monthly water bills and record your consumption so that you’re aware of any spikes in 
     your tariffs and can identify the cause of them. Use a smart water meter for efficient water consumption data 
     and analysis. You can use this to set targets for water efficiency. Conduct regular checks for drips,
